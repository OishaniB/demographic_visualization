#Demographic Visualization in R

This project analyzes a demographic dataset to explore patterns in age, gender, marital status, income, car ownership, and education using R.  
The goal is to uncover insights about how demographic variables relate to income and car prices.

**#Key Features**

- Data import and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on demographic variables
- Visualizations:
  - Age distribution
  - Income distribution
  - Gender distribution
  - Car price category insights
  - Car price by gender
  - Income by education level
  - Income vs. car price

**#Dataset**

The dataset contains the following variables:

- Age  
- Gender  
- Marital status  
- Income  
- Income category  
- Car price  
- Car price category  
- Education level

**#Technologies / Libraries Used**

- R (base functions)
- readxl (for reading Excel files)
- ggplot2 (for enhanced plotting)
